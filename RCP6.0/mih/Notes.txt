April 4, 2014, PLEASE NOTE:

On July 17, 2013 users were notified that the BCCA
precipitation had a dry bias over much of the contiguous U.S., and more
especially over the central and eastern U.S.  This bias has been corrected
with a simple bias-correction in the monthly means.  Please see the Errata document
for more information regarding this issue and correction.  The corrected
BCCA precipitation archive files are referred to as BCCAv2 and were put into
place on April 4, 2014. Documentation including the Errata document will be
updated soon to relect this correction.

I. 	Terms of Use

These projections are being distributed to interested users for
consideration in research to planning applications. Such applications may
include any project carried out by an individual or organized by a
university, a scientific institute, public agency, or private sector entity
for research or planning purposes. Any decision to use these projections is
at the interested user's discretion and subject to the Disclaimer provided
below.

II. 	Disclaimer

These projections are being made available to provide immediate access for
the convenience of interested persons. They are being made available by
Archive Collaborators (i.e. Bureau of Reclamation, Climate Analytics Group,
Climate Central, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Santa Clara
University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, and National Center for Atmospheric
Research. Archive Collaborators believe the information to be correct
representations of potential high-resolution climate/hydrologic variations
and changes subject to the limitations of the CMIP3 and CMIP5 global climate
simulations, and the downscaling methods and their limitations, as described
elsewhere in this web site. However, human and mechanical errors remain
possibilities. Therefore, Archive Collaborators do not guarantee the
accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the
information. Also, neither Archive Collaborators, nor any of the sources of
the information shall be responsible for any errors or omissions, or for the
use or results obtained from the use of this information. 

III. Acknowledgements and Citation of these Projections

Whenever you publish research based on projections from this archive, please
include two acknowledgements:

1. First, acknowledge the superceding CMIP3 effort. The following is language
suggested by the CMIP3 archive hosts at PCMDI: "We acknowledge the modeling
groups, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI)
and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) for their roles in
making available the WCRP CMIP3 multi-model dataset. Support of this dataset
is provided by the Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy." PCMDI also
requests that in first making reference to the projections from this
archive, please first reference the CMIP3 dataset by including the phrase
"the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP's) Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset". Subsequent
references within the same publication might refer to the CMIP3 data with
terms such as "CMIP3 data", "the CMIP3 multi-model dataset", "the CMIP3
archive", or the "CMIP3 dataset".

2. Second, generally acknowledge this archive as "Bias Corrected and Downscaled
WCRP CMIP3 Climate Projections" archive at
http://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip3_projections/. To reference
specific information in the archive, you also use the following references:
